# craft3-universal-dam-integrator

The purpose of this Craft CMS plugin is to offer a generalized means of integrating with most digital asset managers (DAM).

## How does this differ than the Craft CMS CRUD API?

Currently, Craft CMS does not offer the option to save only metadata concerning an asset. Craft makes the assumption that there will always be certain fields populated, such as `tempFilePath` and `newLocation`, etc.

This plugin overrides the core Craft CRUD API functions such that conditional checks for these upload-specific fields are removed, including checks for validation, so that asset metadata records can be inserted into the `elements`, `assets`, `content` and `element_sites` tables without an actual upload.

## External volumes vs read-only assets

This plugin does not make use of any external volume and insteads treats the asset files themselves as read-only (no transformations from within Craft, currently) such that the hosting of assets is not duplicated between the DAM hosting provider and Craft hosting.

## Reconciliation

Notes forthcoming
